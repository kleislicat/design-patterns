# Course Overview

*(from **Udemy Course** - "Java Design Patterns & SOLID Design Principles" by __Coffee Powered Crew__)*

This course starts with SOLID Design Principles in Java. It will then provide a comprehensive introduction to Java Design patterns with practical, hands on exercises.



What are SOLID Design Principles?

SOLID design principles are almost a mandatory skill for every Java developer. These principles enable you to write most reusable & clean Java code in your projects.

You'll learn SOLID Principles which are:


>- Single Responsibility Principle
>
>- Open-Closed Principle
>
>- Liskov Substitution Principle
>
>- Interface Segregation Principle
>
>- Dependency Inversion Principle



All these principles are explained in detail and you'll refactor existing Java code and apply these principles in hands on exercise along with me.

Then we move on to **Java Design Patterns**.

To learn about the design patterns using Java programming language we'll discuss:   


>- Learn what kind of problems are solved by each design pattern.
>
>- Discuss various roles in the design pattern using UML diagrams.
>
>- We'll use UML of example that we are going to solve as well as UMLs from gang of four book
>
>- Discuss how the design  pattern is applied in the example & how various parts fit together.
>
>- Hands on example using Java in Eclipse IDE that uses the design pattern.
>
>- Various design & implementation considerations for every design pattern.
>
>- Discuss how the design pattern varies from another similar pattern.
>
>- See where a design pattern is used in real life.

This course covers all the classic design patterns from the *Gang of Four (GoF)* book. In addition we'll discuss few newer design patterns that are used in modern software development. We'll discuss how a pattern can be implemented in various ways & how we can tailor them to be used with Java language.

This course is the **Most Comprehensive course on Java Design Patterns** that you can find.
